Progress Report 4

April 8, 2022

This past week dealt with lots of difficulties in my project. My original three-wheeled Boe-Bot robot that I was going to use I learned had a lot of difficulties. It would sometimes turn the correct angle and sometimes not. This had to do with the differential drive. I last minute this week decided to switch to the two-wheeled E-puck robot. It is two wheels and has differential drive as well. There is lots more documentation on this robot so I hope it will help. I needed the wheel radius and axle length between wheels from a lot of the documentation I had been reading in order to turn a specific angle away from an obstacle. All the source code for it turning a specific angle is in C, which I am not that familiar with it. I am halfway through converting it to Python in my code so it will work with my LiDAR and GPS code that I already wrote the functions for. I can turn the epuck for a specific angle and get distance readings. However, it sometimes has been causing Webots to crash which has affected my progress for it. It will be mid-code and stop responding. I am hoping over the next few days I can get it figured out to where it will work correctly and Webots stays not crashing. It will crash mid-run which has prevented me from making signfiicant progress this past week. I am hoping to combine the LiDAR, movement of the epuck, and GPS system I have in place all together to get my collision avoidance algorithm working correctly this next week.
