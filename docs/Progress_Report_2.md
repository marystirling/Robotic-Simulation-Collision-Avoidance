Progress Report 2

February 4, 2022

This past week, I have made more progress on the setup of my project. The robot that I have chosen to use for my project is Parallax's Boe-Bot. It is a three-wheeled robot that performs successful maneuvers. It also has two distance sensors on the side that I could utilize in my implementation of a collision avoidance algorithm. I have also found many tutorials to help me learn how to control this robot in Webots. I am planning on adding a rotating LiDAR sensor to the top of this robot. There are several options that I am still researching in determining which would be best useful for my purposes. I plan to most likely use a 1-layer LiDAR so there is less data to filter through. However, I have found some LiDAR's with 4-layers of data points which would still be a good amount to filter through. Next week, I am planning on actually building this in Webots and begin coding basic movements for the robot for me to get use to it. I am also planning on seeing how I collect the data from the LiDAR in my code so that I can use it for my collision avoidance alogrithm. 

Also, this week I have been researching more into collision avoidance algorithms. The main one I am focusing on is Artificial Potential Fields. It essentially is creating a simulated electric field where the robot is attracted to its target destination and repelled by obstacles. I plan to implement some sort of version of this in my senior project. I am hoping to use this to be able to create my own version of something similar. I am going to look more into this in the next few weeks once I learn more about how my robot and LiDAR sensor in Webots will work. 

These upcoming weeks I have some goals that I wish to achieve. First, I want to finalize a model for my robot and build it in Webots. Then, I want to learn how to move it and access the data from the distance sensors and LiDAR. Then, I want to construct some sort of environment with obstacles in the way of the robot reaching its target destination. I know that in the future I may need to add other sensors and accessories, such as a GPS system, accelerometer, magnetomer, and maybe a few others. These sensors would help me navigate around obstacles. Also, I am planning on continuing research into collision avoidance algorithms.
