Progress Report 3

April 1, 2022

These past few weeks, I have made a lot of progress in truly mastering Webots and robotics coding. More specifically, I have stored my LiDAR data stream in a tuple. I have also calculated the angle from the robot that the distance from an object was measured. This is going to be the most vital data from my project as it will be used to avoid collision with an obstacle. I have decided, for simplicity due to time restraints, to use a 1 layer LiDAR with 25 distance points with a 90 degree field of vision. This took a lot of testing for trial and error to figure out exactly what angle from the robot the measurement is coming from as there was no documentation detailing this. Thus, the LiDAR is finalized and ready to be used for my project.

Next, I have been learning truly how to turn and move the robot. One thing that took a long time was discovering that my robot uses differential drive. This means that the robot's movement is based on two wheels on either side of the robot's body. I had originally not been coding in this way, which caused my robot to not turn or move the way that I had intended. This was a big obstacle to get over as it caused a lot of time to research what was wrong. Now, I am able to move my robot and turn specific angles for a certain amount of time. I can successfully move forward, backwards, left, and right. With this, I have begun constructing a collision avoidance algorithm. The basics of this will be to continually read in distance measurements from the LiDAR. When an object is within a certain distance, the robot will turn a certain angle and move forward if there is no objects in its turn path. Then, I will calculate the heading angle to correctly turn the robot back towards its target destination. This will repeat until the robot successfully reaches its target destination through GPS integration. While this is a fairly simple collision avoidance algorithm, it does not involve an integrated point cloud analysis from many previously researched complex collision avoidance algorithms that requires a lot of time to process and store the data. This developed algorithm will allow me to learn many properties of robotic autonomous navigation, as robotics is what I want to pursue research in during graduate schoool.

These final few weeks is when I will be coding a successful collision avoidance algorithm. I will also be testing with various obstacles in the way. I will record the  distance from target destination, obstacles in its path, amount of obstacles hit, and the time it takes for the robot to reach its target destination (if it makes it). I am hoping, time allowing, that I will be able to complete research in this and that it will successfully work the way I intend.
