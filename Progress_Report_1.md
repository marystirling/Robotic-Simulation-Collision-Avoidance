Progress Report 1
January 28, 2022

  I have begun finalizing planning for my senior project. I want to do a robotic collision avoidance simulation using a software called Webots. The goal by the end of it is if the three-wheeled robot is successfully able to navigate around obstacles to reach target destinations. It will be in an outdoor environment. I have experience using LiDAR sensors so I most likely will implement those. However, I may look into different sensors and experiment with different kinds. Some of the current collision avoidance algorithms that I am researching are artificial potential fields and line-edge detection. I plan to use them to either combine features of them into an efficient collision avoidance algorithm or create my own from scratch. 

  My progress in Webots has not begun that much yet. I have been playing around with the software to get a feel how it simulates robotics in real life. I began looking through the hardware that I am able to use. Luckily, they have it fairly easy to choose with a selection of already built robots and sensor attachments that I can use an API to code with. I am hoping that this upcoming week I can finalize the hardware and sensors that I am to use and get a feel for the API by practicing moving the robot around. This upcoming week as well, I am also going to start doing more research into those sensors and hardware in applying them to the collision avoidance algorithms that I have been researching. I am excited about this project so far!
